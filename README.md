# PilotsDeck_VIZIX

This is a fork of the briliant https://github.com/Fragtality/PilotsDeck_FNX with modifications to make it work better with the VIZIX autopilot controller.

Read their readme for more details but simply:

1) Make sure you have the latest version of FSUIPC installed
2) Put this .exe say C:\pilotsdeck\
3) Run it (and FSUIPC) after MSFS has started
4) Load the Fenix A320 - PilotsDeck profile
5) Should magically work!

I'll try to keep this updated with the base repo, because as this is doing memory reading it's prone to breaking, but it works!
